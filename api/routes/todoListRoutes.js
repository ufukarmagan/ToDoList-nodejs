//Routing refers to determining how an application responds to a client request for a specific endpoint, 
//which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on).

//Each of our routes has different route handler functions, which are executed when the route is matched.

//we required the controller so each of the routes methods can call itâ€™s respective handler function.
